TypeScript configuration files in the frontend folder:

tsconfig.json:


tsconfig.json:(1-11)
This is the root TypeScript configuration file. It acts as a reference manager, pointing to two other config files:

tsconfig.app.json: For the React application code
tsconfig.node.json: For Node.js specific code (like Vite config)

tsconfig.app.json:


tsconfig.app.json:(1-21)
This configures TypeScript for your React application code:

Sets ES2020 as the target JavaScript version
Enables React JSX support
Sets up module resolution for bundlers like Vite
Configures strict type checking
Includes DOM types for browser APIs

tsconfig.node.json:


tsconfig.node.json:(1-21)
This configures TypeScript for Node.js environment code:

Specifically includes vite.config.ts
Uses ES2022 target
Doesn't include DOM types (since it's for Node.js)
Also sets up module resolution for bundlers


The split configuration serves several purposes:

Separation of Concerns: Different parts of your codebase need different settings
Browser code needs DOM types
Node.js code needs different target versions
Different module resolution strategies
Performance: By splitting configs, TypeScript only loads the necessary type definitions for each context, making type checking faster
Clarity: Makes it clear which files are meant for browser vs Node.js environments
Vite Integration: Vite specifically looks for this structure to properly handle TypeScript in both browser and Node.js contexts

You could technically combine these into one file, but the separation is a best practice for larger applications, especially when using modern build tools like Vite.
